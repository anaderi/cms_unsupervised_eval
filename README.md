# Unsupervised* learning on CMS data

The project is intended to find good features / distance functions for the data from CMS experiment.
This set of features should discriminate different decay channels.

\* not only supervised, we are using labeled toyMC data to check our guesses.

We are using [IPython](http://ipython.org/) for analyses (an interactive shell for python language)
