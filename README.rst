CMS unsupervised machine learning (CMSUML)
==========================================

The project is intended to find good features / distance functions for the data from CMS experiment.
This set of features should discriminate different decay channels.

* not only supervised, we are using toyMC with answers to check our guesses.

We are using IPython for analyses (an interactive shell for python language)

Tested under python 2.7
